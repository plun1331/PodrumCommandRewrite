# Command Rewrite
A Podrum plugin that replaces the default commands, as well as adds some new ones.

The [Podrum software](/Podrum/Podrum) is currently a work in progress, so currently this is useless.

# How to Install
1. Go to the [releases section](https://github.com/plun1331/PodrumCommandRewrite/releases) and download the following files from the latest release:
  
  - `CommandsRewrite.pyz`
  - `CommandManager.py`
  
2. Put `CommandsRewrite.pyz` into your Podrum server's plugin folder.
3. Replace the file at `src\podrum\command\CommandManager.py` with your downloaded `CommandManager.py`.
4. Run the server.
